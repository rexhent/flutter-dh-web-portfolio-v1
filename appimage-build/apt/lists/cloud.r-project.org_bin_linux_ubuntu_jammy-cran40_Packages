Description: Just Another Gibbs Sampler for Bayesian MCMC - binary
 JAGS is Just Another Gibbs Sampler.  It is a program for analysis of
 Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
 simulation not wholly unlike BUGS.
 .
 JAGS was written with three aims in mind:
  * To have an engine for the BUGS language that runs on Unix
  * To be extensible, allowing users to write their own functions,
    distributions and samplers.
  * To be a plaftorm for experimentation with ideas in Bayesian modelling
 .
 This package contains the 'jags' binary as well as the associated
 shared library modules loaded by the binary.

Description: GNU R scripting and command-line front-end -- transition package
 The 'r' (aka 'littler') program provides a lightweight binary wrapper around
 the GNU R language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
 .
 While R can be used in batch mode, the r binary adds full support for
 both 'shebang'-style scripting (i.e. using a  hashmark-exclamation-path
 expression as the first line in scripts) as well as command-line use in
 standard Unix pipelines. In other words, r provides the R language without
 the environment.
 .
 This virtual package ensures that 'r-cran-littler' is installed. Once that
 is done, this 'littler' package can be removed.

Description: GNU R core of statistical computation and graphics system
 R is a system for statistical computation and graphics.  It consists
 of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger,
 access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs
 stored in script files.
 .
 The design of R has been heavily influenced by two existing languages:
 Becker, Chambers & Wilks' S and Sussman's Scheme.  Whereas the
 resulting language is very similar in appearance to S, the underlying
 implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme.
 .
 The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows
 branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.
 Most of the user-visible functions in R are written in R.  It is
 possible for the user to interface to procedures written in the
 C, C++, or FORTRAN languages for efficiency, and many of R's core
 functions do so.  The R distribution contains functionality for a
 large number of statistical procedures and underlying applied math
 computations.  There is also a large set of functions which provide
 a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data
 presentations.
 .
 Additionally, several thousand extension "packages" are available
 from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, many also as Debian
 packages, named 'r-cran-<name>'.
 .
 This package provides the core GNU R system from which only the optional
 documentation packages r-base-html, r-doc-html, r-doc-pdf and r-doc-info
 have been split off to somewhat reduce the size of this package.

Description: GNU R core of statistical computation and graphics system
 R is a system for statistical computation and graphics.  It consists
 of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger,
 access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs
 stored in script files.
 .
 The design of R has been heavily influenced by two existing languages:
 Becker, Chambers & Wilks' S and Sussman's Scheme.  Whereas the
 resulting language is very similar in appearance to S, the underlying
 implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme.
 .
 The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows
 branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.
 Most of the user-visible functions in R are written in R.  It is
 possible for the user to interface to procedures written in the
 C, C++, or FORTRAN languages for efficiency, and many of R's core
 functions do so.  The R distribution contains functionality for a
 large number of statistical procedures and underlying applied math
 computations.  There is also a large set of functions which provide
 a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data
 presentations.
 .
 Additionally, several thousand extension "packages" are available
 from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, many also as Debian
 packages, named 'r-cran-<name>'.
 .
 This package provides the core GNU R system from which only the optional
 documentation packages r-base-html, r-doc-html, r-doc-pdf and r-doc-info
 have been split off to somewhat reduce the size of this package.

Description: GNU R installation of auxiliary GNU R packages
 R is a system for statistical computation and graphics.  It consists
 of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger,
 access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs
 stored in script files.
 .
 The design of R has been heavily influenced by two existing languages:
 Becker, Chambers & Wilks' S and Sussman's Scheme.  Whereas the
 resulting language is very similar in appearance to S, the underlying
 implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme.
 .
 The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows
 branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.
 Most of the user-visible functions in R are written in R.  It is
 possible for the user to interface to procedures written in the
 C, C++, or FORTRAN languages for efficiency, and many of R's core
 functions do so.  The R distribution contains functionality for a
 large number of statistical procedures and underlying applied math
 computations.  There is also a large set of functions which provide
 a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data
 presentations.
 .
 Additionally, several thousand extension "packages" are available from
 CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, many also as Debian packages,
 named 'r-cran-<name>'.
 .
 This package ensures that other Debian packages needed for installation of
 some auxiliary R packages are installed.

Description: GNU R html docs for statistical computing system functions
 R is a system for statistical computation and graphics.  It consists
 of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger,
 access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs
 stored in script files.
 .
 The design of R has been heavily influenced by two existing languages:
 Becker, Chambers & Wilks' S and Sussman's Scheme.  Whereas the
 resulting language is very similar in appearance to S, the underlying
 implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme.
 .
 The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows
 branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.
 Most of the user-visible functions in R are written in R.  It is
 possible for the user to interface to procedures written in the
 C, C++, or FORTRAN languages for efficiency, and many of R's core
 functions do so.  The R distribution contains functionality for a
 large number of statistical procedures and underlying applied math
 computations.  There is also a large set of functions which provide
 a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data
 presentations.
 .
 Additionally, several thousand extension "packages" are available from
 CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, many also as Debian packages,
 named 'r-cran-<name>'.
 .
 This package provides html documentation suitable for browsing with a
 web-browser for the libraries included in the r-base package. It is not
 a required package as the same documentation is already included for
 on-line browsing.

Description: GNU R scripting and command-line front-end
 The 'r' (aka 'littler') program provides a lightweight binary wrapper around
 the GNU R language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
 .
 While R can be used in batch mode, the r binary adds full support for
 both 'shebang'-style scripting (i.e. using a  hashmark-exclamation-path
 expression as the first line in scripts) as well as command-line use in
 standard Unix pipelines. In other words, r provides the R language without
 the environment.

Description: GNU R html manuals for statistical computing system
 R is a system for statistical computation and graphics.  It consists
 of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger,
 access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs
 stored in script files.
 .
 The design of R has been heavily influenced by two existing languages:
 Becker, Chambers & Wilks' S and Sussman's Scheme.  Whereas the
 resulting language is very similar in appearance to S, the underlying
 implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme.
 .
 The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows
 branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.
 Most of the user-visible functions in R are written in R.  It is
 possible for the user to interface to procedures written in the
 C, C++, or FORTRAN languages for efficiency, and many of R's core
 functions do so.  The R distribution contains functionality for a
 large number of statistical procedures and underlying applied math
 computations.  There is also a large set of functions which provide
 a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data
 presentations.
 .
 Additionally, several thousand extension "packages" are available from
 CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, many also as Debian packages,
 named 'r-cran-<name>'.
 .
 This package provides the R manuals in html format. The sibling packages
 r-doc-pdf and r-doc-info provides the same manuals.

Description: GNU R info manuals statistical computing system
 R is a system for statistical computation and graphics.  It consists
 of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger,
 access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs
 stored in script files.
 .
 The design of R has been heavily influenced by two existing languages:
 Becker, Chambers & Wilks' S and Sussman's Scheme.  Whereas the
 resulting language is very similar in appearance to S, the underlying
 implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme.
 .
 The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows
 branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.

Description: GNU R standalone mathematics library
 R is a system for statistical computation and graphics.  It consists
 of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger,
 access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs
 stored in script files.
 .
 The design of R has been heavily influenced by two existing languages:
 Becker, Chambers & Wilks' S and Sussman's Scheme.  Whereas the
 resulting language is very similar in appearance to S, the underlying
 implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme.
 .
 The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows
 branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.
 Most of the user-visible functions in R are written in R.  It is
 possible for the user to interface to procedures written in the
 C, C++, or FORTRAN languages for efficiency, and many of R's core
 functions do so.  The R distribution contains functionality for a
 large number of statistical procedures and underlying applied math
 computations.  There is also a large set of functions which provide
 a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data
 presentations.
 .
 Additionally, several thousand extension "packages" are available from
 CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, many also as Debian packages,
 named 'r-cran-<name>'.
 .
 This package provides the libRmath shared and static libraries which can
 be called from standalone C or C++ code.

Description: GNU R collection of recommended packages [metapackage]
 R is a system for statistical computation and graphics.  It consists
 of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger,
 access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs
 stored in script files.
 .
 The design of R has been heavily influenced by two existing languages:
 Becker, Chambers & Wilks' S and Sussman's Scheme.  Whereas the
 resulting language is very similar in appearance to S, the underlying
 implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme.
 .
 The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows
 branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.
 Most of the user-visible functions in R are written in R.  It is
 possible for the user to interface to procedures written in the
 C, C++, or FORTRAN languages for efficiency, and many of R's core
 functions do so.  The R distribution contains functionality for a
 large number of statistical procedures and underlying applied math
 computations.  There is also a large set of functions which provide
 a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data
 presentations.
 .
 Additionally, several thousand extension "packages" are available from
 CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, many also as Debian packages,
 named 'r-cran-<name>'.
 .
 This Debian package is now a metapackage that depends on a set of
 packages that are recommended by the upstream R core team as part of a
 complete R distribution, and distributed along with the source of R
 itself, as well as directly via the CRAN network of mirrors. This set
 comprises the following packages (listed in their upstream names):
  - KernSmooth: Functions for kernel smoothing for Wand & Jones (1995)
